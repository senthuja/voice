Every language is different in sound to every other. 
Some are very different and some not so.
Each person from any language can completely master the pronunciation of English,
as long as become aware of the differences and work to eliminate them.

In this post I will bring to your attention one key difference from the following languages.
As well as that, I will talk a little about what you need to do in your mouth to start to approximate to the English version. 
Sometimes you have to do the thing before you can actually hear it!

If you cast your eyes down the list, you will see that sometimes you may have the same problem as a speaker of another language.

Once you have worked at a sound and got a measure of success, scroll to the bottom.
